(5) If Lessees fails to timely pay any amounts due under this lease or if any check of Lessees is not honored by the institution on which it was drawn, Landlord may require Lessees to pay such amount and any subsequent amounts under this lease in certified funds.

<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size:14px">If Landlord does not <u>actually receive</u> a rent payment in the full amount at the designated place of payment for two full days after the day rent is due, then the Lessees will pay the Landlord a late fee calculated as follows:</span>

	<span style="font-size:14px">- The late fee shall be ten dollars ($10) every day until the late fee is the equivalent of ten percent (10%) of the rent. Late fees are capped at 10% of the applicable rental period. </span>

<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size:14px">For the purposes of paying rent and any late charges, the mailbox is not the agent for receipt for Landlord (the postmark date is not the date Landlord receives the payment). The parties agree that the late charge is based on a reasonable estimate of uncertain damages to the Landlord that are incapable of precise calculation and result from late payment of rent. Landlord&rsquo;s acceptance of a late charge does not waive Landlord&rsquo;s right to exercise remedies under this Agreement.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
